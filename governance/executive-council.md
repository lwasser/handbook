# pyOpenSci Executive Council

The pyOpenSci Executive Council (EC) has four primary functions:

1. **Guides the Organization**: The Executive Council defines and directs pyOpenSci’s high-level [mission, vision, and values](mission-values) and sets its strategic direction.

2. **Advocates for pyOpenSci**: The Executive Council serves as an advocate and ambassador for the organization, leveraging members’ networks to enhance its reputation and support fundraising efforts.

3. **Provides Strategic Insight**: The Executive Council offers perspective and guidance on major strategic decisions to ensure the organization’s long-term success.

4. **Holds the [Executive Director](executive-director) accountable**: The Executive Council holds the Executive Director accountable while also providing high-level strategic and financial guidance and oversight.

The Executive Director is currently a voting member of the Executive Council.

The Executive Council holds broad expertise in building and running a scientific / data science nonprofit organization. It is complemented by the [Advisory Council](advisory-council), which offers domain-specific expertise, guidance, and input.


## Executive Council Roles & Responsibilities

Each Executive Council (EC) member dedicates no more than **four to six hours per month** to pyOpenSci activities, including meeting attendance. Executive Council members are expected to fulfill the following responsibilities:

- Attend at least 80% of monthly Executive Council meetings.
- Participate in asynchronous commitments, which include:
  - Suggesting agenda items for meetings.
  - Communicating with the Executive Director (ED) via Slack.
  - Providing timely reviews of materials and documents.
  - Connecting the Executive Director with potential funding opportunities.
- Evaluate the performance of the Executive Director on a yearly basis.
- Approve expense reports.
- Take meeting minutes and ensure they are published.

The Executive Council is currently led by the Executive Council Chair, who approves the Executive Director’s vacation time off requests and sick leave.

### How the Executive Council makes decisions

The Executive Council makes consensus-based decisions. All decisions must align with the legal obligations and policies of pyOpenSci’s fiscal sponsor - Community Initiatives.

### Items that require Executive Council approval

In some situations, the Executive Director should consult the Executive Council to get approval before moving forward. This section describes those scenarios.

### Decisions that require an Executive Council vote

The Executive Council helps to define and direct the strategy and major direction of pyOpenSci. It must approve major decisions that strongly affect pyOpenSci’s strategy or financial well-being. In general, items with legal or fiduciary implications require a vote and the public documentation of the vote's outcome via our [meeting minutes](ec-minutes).

The EC will always vote on the following:

* Annual Budget
* Anything related to pyOpenSci's Mission, vision, values
* Changes in governance and policy (example COC)
    * Changes to the Code of Conduct.
* Significant deviations from the approved yearly budget
* Decisions that have significant implications for pyOpenSci’s financial health.
* Major changes in strategic direction and roadmaps for organization development.

The EC, independent of the Executive Director, also determines the Executive Director's salary.

The Executive Director is given authority to make all other decisions; the Executive Council, however, is a resource for the Executive Director  when they want feedback and input on decisions.


### The Executive Council may also be asked to provide input on

These decisions are significant or public-facing and would benefit from the input of the Executive Council; they do not require a vote to move forward. The Executive Council should be notified using the **executive-council** slack channel.

Here are some items that you may be asked for feedback on.

* Significant public-facing changes to the pyOpenSci website.
* Significant changes that impact staff or Human Resources (hiring, firing ,etc) decisions.
* Operational policy for pyOpenSci staff (unless they have major financial implications).
* Decisions about pursuing proposals and writing grants.
* Decisions about significant changes to pyOpenSci programs



## The Executive Council's Role

The Executive Council is available as a resource for the Executive Director when it is helpful. However, there are also items that require Executive Council approval.


## How the Executive Council works

The pyOpenSci Executive Council operates through open discussions, collaborative decision-making, and a "lazy consensus" principle where decisions move forward unless concerns are explicitly raised. This flexible and adaptive approach ensures that the Executive Council can respond to the needs of the growing pyOpenSci community of practice. We focus on fostering thoughtful dialogue and leveraging diverse perspectives to guide the organization’s [mission, vision, and values](mission-values).

The Executive Council values transparency and clarity, ensuring all members are informed and aligned as we shape the future of pyOpenSci together.

### How we meet and communicate

#### Monthly meetings

The Executive Council holds **monthly meetings** (typically 1.5 hours) to discuss key topics, review updates, and make decisions by consensus. During these meetings, the Executive Director (ED) provides updates on the organization’s development, growth, and operations and may request feedback on specific issues. This time is also used for strategic planning and discussion

During these meetings, Council members take notes. These notes are summarized and published in the [pyOpenSci handbook GitHub repository](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/handbook/tree/main/reference/meeting-notes/executive-council).  Once the notes are merged, they are [publicly available in this Handbook](https://www.pyopensci.org/handbook/reference/meeting-notes/executive-council/intro.html).


**Ad hoc Executive Council meetings** are scheduled as needed to address pressing issues.

**Executive Director--Executive Council Chair meetings:** The Executive Director also meets regularly with the pyOpenSci Board Chair to ensure alignment on key issues and strategic direction.


## EC communication platforms & tools

### Slack: primary communication platform

The **[Executive Council Slack channel](pyos-slack)** is the primary tool for communication between monthly meetings. All updates, discussions, and requests for input happen here; email is not used for EC communications.
EC members are expected to check Slack semi-regularly to stay informed.

- **Feedback requests:** It is understood that EC members have jobs and lives outside of their EC responsibilities. As such, when the Executive Director (ED) requests input on Slack, they will specify what feedback is needed and provide clear response timelines and areas to focus on.
- **Transparency:** The Slack channel is also used to share updates about changes that occur outside of formal monthly meetings. Examples of such updates include new hires, event updates, and celebrating successes.

### Google Drive: document sharing and collaboration

The pyOpenSci Executive Council uses a shared **[Google Drive](google-drive)** within the pyOpenSci Google Workspace to store and share documents. This includes meeting notes, agendas, and other important materials. Members are encouraged to access and update shared resources using the shared Drive.

### MOVE Guiding principle: lazy consensus

The EC operates using a "lazy consensus" principle, where decisions move forward unless concerns are explicitly raised. This approach ensures efficient decision-making while allowing members to provide feedback when necessary.
