# Mission and values

The mission of pyOpenSci is to support diverse community around the free, open
python tools that drive open, reproducible scientific workflows.

We support our mission by:

* building community capacity to contribute to open software
* Creating community
* Open peer review
* Training and mentorship

## Why do we support open science?

Science is now data-driven. And as such, data science supports scientists
processing the data that they need to address critical questions.

We value open science workflows because they allow scientists to build upon each
others work rather than recreating already developed workflows. Building on
top of existing workflows supports science developing and evolving at a quicker pace.

## Why is (free) and open source so important?

Open source software refers to the tools that scientists (and others) use to
process data. Free and open software is critical to science as it allows
scientists to freely access the tools that they need to process their data.
If the tools are free and open, then it lowers barriers for others to use them
without having to pay costly subscription fees.

This free and open source software is critical to supporting development of
open scientific workflows
